# Welcome to the NOMAD Measurements Plugin Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the **NOMAD Measurements Plugin**! This plugin is designed to provide structured data schemas for storing experimental measurement data in alignment with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. It serves as a community or standard plugin, offering commonly used schemas and classes/sections for measurement data that can be shared across a community.

## Supported Measurement Techniques

Currently, this plugin supports the following measurement techniques:

- **X-ray Diffraction (XRD)**:
  
  - Supports both 1D and 2D scan data
  - Supports file formats from:
    - Panalytical: `*.xrdml`
    - Bruker: `*.brml`
    - Rigaku: `*.rasx`

Additional measurement techniques are actively being developed and will be included soon, including:

- UV-Vis-NIR Transmission (Perkin Elmer)
- Raman Spectroscopy
- X-ray Fluorescence (XRF)

Stay tuned for updates as more methods become available!
