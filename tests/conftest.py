    Sets up data for testing and cleans up after the test. The data file is parsed,
    returning an `EntryArchive` object. It contains a reference to the `.archive.json`
    file created by plugin parsers for the measurement data. Parsing this
    `.archive.json` file returns the `EntryArchive` object for the measurement data,
    which is finally yeilded to the test function.

    Clean-up:
        By default, the `.archive.json` file is cleaned up after the test. If additional
        files need to be cleaned up, they can be specified in the request.param as a
        tuple or list of file extensions. For example, ('file_path', ['.nxs', '.h5'])
        can be used to clean up '.nxs' and '.h5' files in addition to '.archive.json'.
        If only the '.archive.json' file needs to be cleaned up, ('file_path',) can be
        used as parameters for the fixture.
